# 🌍 NGO Fund Tracker - Transparent Donation DApp

## 🏷️ Project Title
**NGO Fund Tracker: Transparency in Donations**

---

## 📖 Project Description
The **NGO Fund Tracker** is a blockchain-based decentralized application (DApp) designed to ensure **transparency in NGO donations**.  
It allows individuals to donate Ether (ETH) directly to an NGO’s wallet and view all donation records publicly on the blockchain.  
This ensures that every donor and transaction is **visible, traceable, and immutable** — building trust between NGOs and donors.

## 🎯 Project Vision
To create a **trustworthy and transparent ecosystem** for charity and social welfare organizations using blockchain technology.  
The project aims to eliminate fund misuse by allowing public visibility of donation history and total funds collected.

## 🔑 Key Features
- 💰 **Secure Donations:** Users can donate ETH directly from their wallet to the NGO’s contract.
- 🌐 **Full Transparency:** Every donation (address, amount, timestamp) is stored on-chain and can be publicly viewed.
- 🔒 **Owner-Controlled Withdrawals:** Only the verified NGO wallet (deployer) can withdraw the funds.
- ⏱️ **Real-Time Updates:** Donors can see updated total funds anytime.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- 🌟 Integration with a frontend DApp (React + MetaMask) for easier donation access.
